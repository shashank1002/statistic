    "This is probably the ugliest solution possible to this problem but here goes. Let’s first consider a special case where there are only 2 people (Alice and Bob) and 2 seats on the airplane. Alice picks a seat at random. The only way Bob gets to pick his designated seat is if Alice correctly picks hers. Since there are only 2 choices for Alice she picks her own seat correctly with probability 1/21/2\n",

    "Alice picks her own seat\n",
    "Alice picks Bob’s seat and Bob picks Alice’s seat.\n",
    "In all other cases the probability of Carlos picking his seat is 0. So we have :\n",
